        <p>
          At ING, we have integrated ServiceNow and Azure DevOps so that we can better track and report the KPIs and KRIs of our developers. In addition, we started to use the Demand Management process, which is one of the ITIL requirements. Besides the Change Manager title, I also took the Demand Manager title as the person who contacts the business units.

        <div class="project-title">Change Request Gamification</div>
        <p>
          In order to increase the quality of the Change Requests we discussed at the CAB meetings, I developed a scoring method. After implementing it in ServiceNow - Change Requests, I scored the change requests participating in the meetings for their quality. The points were added later and the points of the teams were declared at the end of each month. This situation started a sweet competition within the company and increased the change request quality. At the same time, that keeps low our IT Risk score, has also reduced the possibility of us having any incidents, bugs etc in the prod environment.

          This is the first time I've dived deep into software development in LeasePlan. How is an analysis done? How is a software developed? What is Agile Working? I found the answers to all these questions in this company. I created a small reporting button on Fleet-Net, the third party vehicle booking ERP system owned by the LeasePlan company, and recorded all my experiences in my internship book for my college.

            Besides soft skill courses,  We sought answers to the questions of how we can improve application performance, how can we develop the third party product (<a href="https://www.sestek.com">SesTek</a>) of Garanti BBVA Emeklilik. Since we do not have the authority to access the codes of this product belonging to SesTek, we made our presentation to C-Level Managers on the last day of the internship, based on customer experience analysis.

            As a work of the Introductory Data Mining Course, I tried to analyze the bike-sharing data sets in the <a href="https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weka"> Weka</a> program. I searched for the most successful classification/clustering/regression methods and selected 1 of them and examined them in detail. I also compared classification performances and class confusion matrices.
